 * @brief This optimization phase selects a memory layout for a particular query.
 * To this end, it traverses all operators in a query plan and sets the selected memory layout information to the schema.
 * Currently the phase supports two MemoryLayoutPolicies:
 * 1. FORCE_ROW_LAYOUT:
 *      This policy enforces a row layout for all operators within an query.
 * 2. FORCE_COLUMN_LAYOUT (experimental):
 *      This policy enforces a column layout for all operators within an query.
 *
 * This phase can't guarantee that a selected layout is really executable, as currently not all data sources support the columnar layout.
 * This would result in failed queryIdAndCatalogEntryMapping at the worker side.
 * Therefore the column layout is currently only experimental.
